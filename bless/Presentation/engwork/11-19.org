My view on Internet Influencers
 It seems to be a better choice for normal people to be Internet Influencers, due to the fast development of the internet industry. But in my view, you definitely need to think twice before making the choice.

 First of all, Internet Influencers are no longer a blue ocean. Many guys just start with the enthusiasm of being another Jaqi Li or someone else that they admire but end up with a total failure. The fast development of the internet industry means not only opportunities but also an emerging monopoly.

 Someone may think that, if you get over all those barriers, and become a successful Internet Influencer. It can't be easier to make a large amount of profit. And becoming a well-known person is a dream come true.
 That sounds quite good, but in such a capitalist world, fame means a lack of liberty. Just as a saying goes, "Capital that never sleeps"
 you work all day around not for yourself, but for that old money.
 Also, you don't have much private time or space to enjoy yourself, since you are already a public figure. There would certainly be many crazy fans trying to break your private life.

 More in-depth said, we shall admit that promote capital flows is awesome, but many Internet Influencers just produce trashes here and there and waste all those precious resources. We shall Contribute our life to more meaningful work.

 So, whether in the degree of difficulty or the values it will produce, I do not think being an Internet Influencer could be a good choice. You may easily be a loser. Or if you succeed, you may find your life occupied with all those meaningless things and could not regain control.
All in all, you shall not choose to be an Internet Influencer and be the master of your own sea.
