** solutions

*** X1 + X2 + X3 < 11 while X{1,2,3} is a nonnegtive integer
大概是高中的隔板法
- answer:78

*** a set {a,b,c,d,e,f} ,get bcf's next order [set means no repeat]
generate permutation **non ordered**
- answer : bcf -> bde
  because it is non-ordered
**** for example
abc->abd->abe->abf-> **acd** *(or acb is same as abc)* -> ace
*** 齐次线性方程组解
see 课本
*** 非齐次线性递归解
